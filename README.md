## üîç Project Insights

### Why Vue.js?

While Nuxt.js offers advantages for large-scale projects, the goal here was to quickly build a small-scale SPA within a tight timeframe. Vue.js, with its efficient learning curve, was the perfect fit.

### Development Journey

The project was developed over a span of 7 days, dedicating 2 hours daily. The journey involved parallel learning from Vue's official documentation and online resources.

### UI/UX

The interface is designed to be user-friendly. Colors indicate flight status, and time formats have been simplified for clarity. Although the initial aim was to meet specified requirements, the project went beyond to offer a richer user experience.

### Future Plans

- **Vuex**: To be introduced for better state management.
- **Nuxt.js**: Exploration for more extensive projects.

### Reflections

Every project is a learning opportunity. This project highlighted the importance of being adaptable, always improving, and the value of continuous learning in the tech world.
